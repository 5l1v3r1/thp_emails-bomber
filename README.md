# The Hacking Project - Emails Bomber


## :mag: The content
In these exercises, I had to make a program that does :
* Scratching of all the town halls of 3 given French departments
* Then send them a personalized email
* And finally, who looks for their Twitter handle and follows them.

**After cloning the repository, make sure to do :**
```sh
$ cd thp_emails-bomber
$ bundle install
```
This will install all the dependencies needed for the exercises.

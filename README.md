# The Hacking Project - Emails

## ðŸ“° The content
In these exercises,  we had to do a lot of things : 
* 

**1 - Scraping data :** <br>
 First of all we had to Scrap some data<br>
 we scrap data from this website : www.annuaire-des-mairies.com/
 
 
**2 - Data storage :** <br>
 after scraping the data we had to store them in the json file
 for use then later in the part 3
 
 
**3 - Sending email  :** <br>
 for this part we use the hash in the json file 
 then we target each email in the hash for sending email.
 
 
 
**4 - Tweeting :** <br>
after sending some email we use the twitter api for tweet something to the same target.

**After cloning the repository, make sure to do :**
```sh
$ cd Emails
$ bundle install
```
This will install all the dependencies needed for the exercises.

Than you can run the programme with 

```sh
$ ruby app.rb
```
